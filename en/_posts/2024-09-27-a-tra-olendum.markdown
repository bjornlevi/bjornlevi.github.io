When we say that we should believe victims, it simply means we acknowledge their experience. It doesn’t mean we need to take drastic actions or seek revenge, but rather provide them with support and understanding. That is the foundation.

Even though we believe victims, it doesn’t mean we need to reject the perspective of others, even those of the alleged perpetrators. People can experience events in completely different ways. We are all shaped by our own experiences, emotions, and context. What one person perceives as harm, another might see very differently – without either of them necessarily lying. This difference in perception is part of being human. Life is rarely black and white. We can take a simple example: two people might look at the same object – one sees the number 6, while from the other perspective, it looks like 9. Both are telling the truth. Both are seeing what they see.

Victims don’t just need to hear "I believe you" – they need to be listened to, understood, and supported. Their experience might be complex and confusing, but that doesn’t change the fact that they need recognition. We can give victims what they need without turning against others.

We also need to understand that it’s human, and indeed very understandable, for people to want to act when they believe an injustice has occurred. It’s difficult to remain passive when you believe someone has been wronged. Especially when we know that the system has often protected alleged perpetrators, which can lead people to feel like they need to take radical actions. The more we see the system fail, the greater the anger becomes. And that anger can grow in all of us.
The truth is that we still haven’t figured out how to handle these important discussions in a world where social media plays such a large role in everything we do. What once took place in closed groups now happens with the megaphone of social media, out in the open. This public discourse can lead to more intense reactions and deeper divisions.

Yet, the effect of this megaphone can also be positive. It was through these open conversations that victims within the Catholic Church in the United States were able to unite and expose years of abuse. That was crucial, and it shows how increased transparency and open discussion can be a powerful tool for justice.

Therefore, we must approach these discussions with caution and sincerity. Believing victims is an important first step, but we also need to be mindful of the consequences of our reactions. Believing victims means, first and foremost, showing them respect and recognition, but it also means approaching all perspectives with care and wisdom.
