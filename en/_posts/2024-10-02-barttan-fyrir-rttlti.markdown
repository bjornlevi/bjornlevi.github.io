"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" is an old version of the golden rule that advises not to do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you. This rule is the foundation of a just and fair society. But the golden rule alone is not enough, as people have different opinions on what is fair. For example, the death penalty is not allowed in Iceland, showing that we do not follow an "eye for an eye" approach. We have learned that punishment equal to the crime does not work; forgiveness and rehabilitation are more important.

Social media has revolutionized our communication, giving anyone a platform to share their opinions. Gossip now reaches everyone, and issues can become fodder for public debate. We should fight for justice and not tolerate unfairness. But we must also be careful, take allegations seriously, and respond with composure. For that, we have law enforcement and the judicial system.

But when the law fails and violence is allowed to continue unchecked, often due to indifference, people take matters into their own hands. If institutions cannot ensure justice, we must take action ourselves—protest and demand change. Such demands must be taken seriously; otherwise, people will have to protest more and shout louder. It seems to me that we are stuck in this vicious cycle, where those in power appear helpless. Despite changes in legislation and increased funding for sexual assault investigations, we are not achieving justice as a society.

To break this vicious circle, we need to rethink our response to injustice. We need to build trust in law enforcement and the judicial system, ensure that cases are investigated professionally, and make the justice system efficient. Education and awareness are key; by educating people about their rights and responsibilities and the consequences of violence and injustice, we can foster better understanding and respect within society. We also need to improve support for victims of violence, both in terms of psychological assistance and legal support.

The government needs to take initiative, genuinely listen, and support a victim-centered society. It should be easier for people to seek justice through the legal system—with better access to legal aid and small claims courts. Democracy demands that those in power be accountable to the people.

In the age of social media, where accounts of alleged violence spread quickly, we need to learn to find social forgiveness. By showing understanding and support to victims, but also giving perpetrators the opportunity to make amends for their mistakes, we can cultivate a culture of empathy and recovery.

The road to justice is sometimes complex, but we must never stop fighting. We need to stay vigilant against injustice, support those in need, and work together for solutions.
